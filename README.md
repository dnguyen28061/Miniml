Welcome to my final project for CS51: Abstraction and Design, a CS course at Harvard. Below you can find my code for writing a miniature interpreter for Ocaml code, written in Ocaml. The interpreter has some of these key features: 

1. Abstract to Concrete Syntax and Vice Versa 
2. Variables 
3. Substitution Semantics 
4. Different evaluation methods: lexical scope and dynamic scope. (Lexical uses variable values declared at function declaration, while dynamic uses the current variable values at function call). 
5. Function calls and recursive function calls. 
6. Exception Handling 

In my Writeup.pdf, you can see some of the challenges I encountered in this project and also an explanation of some of my add-ons from the base project.
